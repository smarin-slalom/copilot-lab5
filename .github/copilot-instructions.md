## Project Context

- Full-stack TODO application with React frontend and Express backend
- Focus on iterative, feedback-driven development
- Current phase: Backend stabilization and frontend feature completion

## Documentation References

Use these documents to understand project standards and implementation expectations:

- [docs/project-overview.md](../docs/project-overview.md) - Architecture, tech stack, and structure
- [docs/testing-guidelines.md](../docs/testing-guidelines.md) - Test patterns and standards
- [docs/workflow-patterns.md](../docs/workflow-patterns.md) - Development workflow guidance

## Development Principles

- Test-Driven Development: Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all feature and fix work.
- Incremental Changes: Prefer small, testable modifications over large rewrites.
- Systematic Debugging: Use test failures as diagnostic guides.
- Validation Before Commit: Ensure all tests pass and no lint errors remain.

## Testing Scope

This project uses unit tests and integration tests only.

- Backend: Jest + Supertest for API testing
- Frontend: React Testing Library for component unit/integration tests
- Manual browser testing for full UI verification
- Do not suggest or implement end-to-end test frameworks such as Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium
- Do not suggest browser automation tools
- Reason: Keep the lab focused on unit/integration tests without e2e complexity

**Testing Approach by Context**

- Backend API changes: Write Jest tests first, then implement changes (Red-Green-Refactor).
- Frontend component features: Write React Testing Library tests first for component behavior, then implement changes (Red-Green-Refactor). Follow with manual browser testing for full UI flows.
- This is true TDD: test first, then code to pass the test.

## Workflow Patterns

Follow these workflows consistently:

1. TDD Workflow: Write/fix tests -> Run -> Fail -> Implement -> Pass -> Refactor
2. Code Quality Workflow: Run lint -> Categorize issues -> Fix systematically -> Re-validate
3. Integration Workflow: Identify issue -> Debug -> Test -> Fix -> Verify end-to-end

## Agent Usage

Use specialized agents based on task type:

- tdd-developer: For test-related work and Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- code-reviewer: For addressing lint errors and code quality improvements

## Memory System

- Persistent Memory: This file (.github/copilot-instructions.md) contains foundational principles and workflows
- Working Memory: .github/memory/ directory contains discoveries and patterns
- During active development, take notes in .github/memory/scratch/working-notes.md (not committed)
- At end of session, summarize key findings into .github/memory/session-notes.md (committed)
- Document recurring code patterns in .github/memory/patterns-discovered.md (committed)
- Reference these files when providing context-aware suggestions

## Workflow Utilities

Use GitHub CLI commands to automate issue-driven workflow steps:

- List open issues: `gh issue list --state open`
- Get issue details: `gh issue view <issue-number>`
- Get issue with comments: `gh issue view <issue-number> --comments`
- The main exercise issue will have "Exercise:" in the title
- Steps are posted as comments on the main issue
- Use these commands when /execute-step or /validate-step prompts are invoked

## Git Workflow

Follow branch and commit conventions:

- Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, etc.
- Feature branches: feature/<descriptive-name>
- Always stage all changes before committing: `git add .`
- Push to the correct branch: `git push origin <branch-name>`
